# Funko-Pop-Server
This project was created for my final Red Badge(Eleven Fifty Academy) project.
It is a postgres server that utilizes four tables: users, items, collections, wishlists.
Users can create a collection or wishlist and add items from the database to their
individual lists.
Included functions: Add user, login user, log out user, get items from database, create a collection,
create a wishlist, update a collection, update a wishlist, delete a collection, delete a wishlist.
Admin exclusive functions: add items, update items, delete items.
**It is not fully operational**

This project was made possible by Kenny Chan (https://github.com/kennymkchan)
and his project (https://github.com/kennymkchan/funko-pop-data.git)

In the 9 months since it's creation, the image url's have been retired.
HobbyDB.com originally provided the data for the original project, but
they have since decided to no longer support student projects.
So, the images are missing.

Hopefully, I will get an opportunity to update all the url's in the future.
